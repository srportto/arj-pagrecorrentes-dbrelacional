# Contributing to Floci UI

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Floci UI is the web console / DevTools
for the [Floci](https://floci.io) local cloud emulator. It is a community-driven
project and all contributions are welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug reports** — open an issue with a minimal reproduction (steps, expected vs. actual)
- **Feature requests** — open an issue describing the console feature or service page you need
- **Pull requests** — bug fixes, new service UI, or UX improvements
- **Service coverage** — wire a new Floci-backed service into the console

## Project Layout

This is a pnpm workspace monorepo with two packages:

| Package | Stack | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/frontend` | React + Vite + TypeScript | The console UI served on port `4500` |
| `packages/api` | Bun + Hono + AWS SDK v3 | Backend on port `4501` that translates the UI's REST/JSON requests into AWS SDK calls against Floci core |

The frontend talks only to `/api/*` (proxied to `packages/api`); the API talks to the
Floci emulators. Never have the frontend reach a cloud endpoint directly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (required by `packages/api`)
- Docker (optional — only for running the full stack via `docker compose`)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/floci-io/floci-ui.git
cd floci-ui
pnpm install
```

### Run

The UI needs three components running: Floci core (`:4566`), the API (`:4501`), and the
frontend (`:4500`).

**Option A — Docker Compose (recommended):**

```bash
docker compose up                        # AWS-only
docker compose --profile multicloud up   # adds Azure + GCP emulators
```

**Option B — local dev (three terminals):**

```bash
# 1. Floci core (see README for the docker run / local-clone options)
# 2. API backend
pnpm dev:api
# 3. Frontend
pnpm dev
```

Open the UI at http://127.0.0.1:4500/. See [README.md](README.md) for full setup,
environment variables, and troubleshooting.

### Checks

Run these before opening a PR:

```bash
pnpm lint          # eslint (frontend)
pnpm type-check    # tsc on both packages
pnpm test          # bun test (api)
pnpm build         # production build
```

## Branching Model

Floci UI uses a **tag-driven release model**. Docker images are never published on PR
merge — only when a maintainer pushes a version tag.

| Branch / ref | Purpose | Docker published? |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Integration branch — all PRs merge here. Treated as unstable. | No |
| `X.Y.Z` tag | Signals a release. Triggers the multi-arch Docker publish pipeline. | Yes (`floci/floci-ui:x.y.z`, `floci/floci-ui:latest`) |

## Commit Message Format

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

> **The PR title should follow this format**, since it becomes the squash-merge commit message.

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

- **type** — one of the values in the table below (lowercase)
- **scope** — optional, in parentheses, identifies the package or service area
  (e.g. `frontend`, `api`, `s3`, `ec2`, `serverless`, `docker`, `ci`)
- **description** — short summary in the imperative mood, no trailing period
- Append `!` before the colon to signal a breaking change: `feat(api)!:`

| Type | When to use | Version bump |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `feat` | New console feature, service page, or API route | minor |
| `fix` | Bug fix or compatibility correction | patch |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | patch |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit | patch |
| `docs` | Documentation only | none |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace — no logic change | none |
| `chore` | Build, CI, dependencies, housekeeping | none |
| `refactor` | Code restructure without behavior change | none |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests | none |
| `build` | Build system or tooling changes | none |
| `ci` | CI workflow changes | none |
| `BREAKING CHANGE` | Footer or `!` suffix — incompatible change | major |

### Valid examples ✅

```
feat(s3): add object preview panel to the bucket explorer
fix(api): handle missing region in EC2 status call
perf(frontend): memoize the service catalog query
chore: bump vite to 5.4
docs: update README with multicloud compose profile
refactor(serverless): extract lambda env-var mapping
test(api): cover the clouds/aws/status route
feat(api)!: change resource list response shape
ci: add multi-arch release workflow
```

### Invalid examples ❌

```
Add object preview                   # missing type
Feature: add something               # "Feature" is not a valid type
feat : space before colon            # space before colon
feat(s3)add missing colon            # missing colon
FIX(api): uppercase type             # type must be lowercase
feat(my scope): scope has spaces     # scope cannot contain spaces
wip: still working on this           # "wip" is not a recognised type
```

## Adding a New Service UI

When wiring a new service into the console, follow these rules:

- Use existing Floci AWS-compatible endpoints. Do not add custom backend endpoints
  just for the UI unless the core project explicitly accepts that contract.
- In `packages/api`, add a route that calls the appropriate AWS SDK v3 client against
  Floci core — never invent a custom protocol.
- In `packages/frontend`, add the service page and register it in the navigation.
- Prefer real empty states over sample data; show placeholders when a service is not
  wired yet. No decorative data or fake operational metrics.
- Keep service status notes in the README accurate.
- Add verification notes for any newly wired operations.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Branch off `main`: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
2. Open a PR targeting `main`.
3. Make sure `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` all pass before requesting review.
4. Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR.
5. Reference any related issues in the PR description.

Docker images are never built on contributor PRs, so merging to `main` is always cheap.

## Release Process (maintainers)

Releases are triggered by pushing a version tag matching `X.Y.Z`:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git tag 1.2.3
git push origin 1.2.3
```

The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the frontend bundle
and the API binary, then packages and pushes a multi-arch (`linux/amd64,linux/arm64`)
image as `floci/floci-ui:1.2.3` and `floci/floci-ui:latest`.

Publishing requires the `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` repository secrets.

## Testing Policy for Pull Requests

As a project policy:

- Pull requests that introduce new behavior should include tests that validate it
  (`bun test` in `packages/api`), or a clear note on why they can't be tested in isolation.
- Pull requests that fix bugs should include a regression test whenever realistic.
- Documentation, formatting, dependency housekeeping, or low-risk refactors may not
  require new tests — but `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`, and the existing suite must
  still pass.

All checks (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`) must pass before merge.
